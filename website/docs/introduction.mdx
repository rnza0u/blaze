Welcome to Blaze docs.

It is split into different sections :

- [**Guides**](./guides/get-started.mdx) : The main documentation on how to use Blaze.
- [**CLI reference**](./cli/blaze.mdx) : Manuals for each Blaze command.
- **Configuration reference** : Blaze configuration files schemas.
- [**Executors**](./executors/executors.mdx) : All about executors, Blaze plugin system.

For issues and bugs, please make sure to use [our issue tracker](https://github.com/rnza0u/blaze/issues).

## What is a monorepo ?

If you have never heard of monorepos, the concept is actually quite simple.

Traditionnally, each *component* lives in its own repository :

```
├── my-company-web-app/
|   ├── .git/
|   ├── src/
├── my-company-server/
|   ├── .git/
|   ├── src/
├── my-company-design-system/
|   ├── .git/
|   ├── src/
```

A monorepo is based on a single repository where you would store all the code and assets for every component in your projects :

```
├── my-company/
|   ├── web-app/
|   |   ├── src/
|   ├── server/
|   |   ├── src/
|   ├── design-system/
|   |   ├── src/
├── .git/
```

A monorepo gives the following advantages:

- **Reusability :** You can easily reuse things among projects, whether they are applications, librairies, CI/CD parts, or tools.
- **Simplicity :** You have one single repository to sync with. A lot of people find it difficult to deal with many repositories, especially when it comes to integration and deployment.
- **Easy dependencies management :** It is much easier to manage dependencies between projects and make them work together during development when using a monorepo.
- **Better collaboration :** It it easier for teams to collaborate since every project is in the same monorepo.
- **Better versioning :** Allows you to perform [atomic commits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_commit) across projects.

## What is Blaze ?

Blaze is a build system which aims to be simple, fast, and flexible.

It is written with ❤️ in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and is [**absolutely free**](https://github.com/rnza0u/main/blob/master/blaze/LICENCE) to use.

Its main goal is to allow you to run multiple tasks across your monorepo using in a efficient.

Blaze is mainly intended to be used in a monorepo, but it can also be used for more general task running and productivity tooling.

It comes with the following features :

- Fully configurable cache
- Parallelization
- Support for JSON, YAML and Jsonnet, with advanced templating features
- A flexible plugin system for running tasks

## Other open-source monorepo tools like Blaze

Blaze is inspired from tools like [Nx](https://nx.dev/), [Turborepo](https://turborepo.org) (and others).

Choose Blaze if you **want** your build system to:

- ✅ Be minimalistic and flexible.
- ✅ Let you (and only you) manage and organize your development workflow.
- ✅ Be blazing fast !

Also, choose Blaze if you **don't want** your build system to: 

- ❌ Manage your application dependencies.
- ❌ Perform code analysis.
- ❌ Be aware of the technologies you're using.
