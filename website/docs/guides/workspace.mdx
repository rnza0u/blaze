A Blaze workspace is composed of a set of projects.

A project can representing anything, from a single asset to a monolithic full-app. You can have as many as you want.

A project might require tasks, build logic to be done, or can also be made out of simple static files.

Your workspace configuration is mostly done in a declarative format (Jsonnet, JSON, or YAML).

:::info

[Jsonnet](https://jsonnet.org/) is Blaze default file format. Don't worry if you are only familiar with JSON because any JSON is a valid Jsonnet document. It offers much more features than JSON and you will be able to learn some patterns along this documentation.

:::

Each project is described in its own configuration file. In this example, `project.json` files :

```
├── my-company/
|   ├── .git/
|   ├── web-app/
|   |   ├── src/
|   |   ├── project.json
|   ├── server/
|   |   ├── src/
|   |   ├── project.json
|   ├── design-system/
|   |   ├── src/
|   |   ├── project.json
|   ├── workspace.json
```

## Workspace configuration

The `workspace.json` file is the monorepo's main configuration file. It is the place to go when you want to :

- Declare projects and their locations.
- Set global settings across the whole monorepo.

It must be located at the root of your monorepo. Blaze will lookup for any of these variants :

- `workspace.json`
- `workspace.yaml`
- `workspace.yml`
- `workspace.jsonnet`

Here is an example of the default version that gets generated when calling the `init` command :

```json
{
  "name": "my-workspace",
  "projects": {},
  "settings": {
    "defaultSelector": [],
    "selectors": {},
    "parallelism": "None",
    "logLevel": "Warn",
    "resolutionParallelism": "None"
  }
}
```

### Manage projects

The `projects` key contains references to all of your workspace projects.

It must be an object mapping where each key is a project name. 

Values are relative paths from the workspace root to the folder where the project is located.

For instance, the following configuration ...

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "app-1-webapp": "app-1/webapp",
    "app-1-server": "app-1/server",
    "app-2-webapp": "app-2/webapp",
    "app-2-server": "app-2/server",
    "design-system": "design-system"
  }
}
```

... could match the following file structure :

```
├── app-1/
|  ├── webapp/
|  |  ├── project.json
|  ├── server/
|  |  ├── project.json
├── app-2/
|  ├── webapp/
|  |  ├── project.json
|  ├── server/
|  |  ├── project.json
├── design-system
|  ├── project.json
```

### Project reference fields

Projects can be provided as simple paths at the `projects` key. 

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "project-name": "path/to/the/project"
  }
}
``` 

This is actually a syntaxic sugar for the following:

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "project-name": {
      "path": "path/to/the/project"
    }
  }
}
```

It is also possible to pass more options.

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "web-app": {
      "path": "path/to/the/project",
      "tags": ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"],
      "description": "Some description for my project"
    },
  }
}
```

- `tags`: A list of tags for this project. Useful for when [selecting projects](./running-targets.mdx#using-tags).
- `description`: A description for the project. Useful for when [describing the workspace](#describing-the-workspace).

### Global settings

The `settings` key is where you can set some default settings across the whole monorepo.

#### Logging level

The `settings.logLevel` key allows you to set the global log level.

There are 4 log levels in Blaze :

- `Info`: When some useful information is logged
- `Error`: When an error is logged
- `Warn`: When a warning message is logged
- `Debug`: For debugging purposes

When you set a log level, every level that follows in the list will not be printed to the console.

The default log level is `Warn`, so only `Info`, `Error` and `Warn` logs will be printed.

`Info` level messages will be printed to `stdout`, all other levels are printed to `stderr`. If you want to redirect Blaze output, you probably want to make sure you redirect both of these streams.

:::info

You can also customize Blaze log level with the global CLI option `--log-level`.

:::

#### Parallelism

The level of parallelism to use when running targets across multiple projects can be customized using the `settings.parallelism` key.

There are four possible values :

- `Infinite`: Blaze will run as many executions in parallel as possible, regardless of the numbers of cores on the system.
- `All`: The maximum number of targets running in parallel is set to the numbers of logical cores on the system.
- `None`: Run each target sequentially.
- A number representing the maximum number of targets that can run in parallel.

:::info

The `run` command also allows to override the level of parallelism with the [`--parallelism` option](./running-targets.mdx#parallelism).

:::

#### Resolution parallelism

The level of parallelism to use when resolving custom executors can be customized using the `settings.resolutionParallelism` key.

It works exactly like the [`settings.parallelism` parameter](#parallelism).

#### Project selection

##### Named selectors

Named selectors allows you to create reusable selectors. 

You can define named selectors in the workspace configuration, at the `settings.selectors` :

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "app-1-webapp": {
      "path": "app-1/webapp",
      "tags": ["web", "js"]
    },
    "app-1-server": {
      "path": "app-1/server",
      "tags": ["server", "rust"]
    },
    "app-1-docs": {
      "path": "app-1/docs",
      "tags": ["docs"]
    },
    "app-2-webapp": {
      "path": "app-2/webapp",
      "tags": ["web", "js"]
    },
    "app-2-server": {
      "path": "app-2/server",
      "tags": ["server", "node"]
    },
    "shared-lib-1": {
      "path": "libs/shared-lib-1",
      "tags": ["js", "lib"]
    },
    "shared-lib-2": {
      "path": "libs/shared-lib-2",
      "tags": ["rust", "lib"]
    }
  },
  "settings": {
    "selectors": {
      // simple array of project names
      "app-2": [
        "app-2-webapp",
        "app-2-server"
      ],
      // include/exclude patterns with regular expressions
      "app-1-runtime": {
        "include": [
          "app-1-.*"
        ],
        "exclude": [
          "app-1-docs"
        ]
      },
      // all project with at least one of the following tags
      "libs": {
        "tags": ["lib"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

When using a command that requires selecting projects, the `-s` option (`--selector` in its long form) allows you to use one of these named selectors. 

##### Default selector

WHen selecting projects, you can also omit the project selector.

In that case, any selector declared at the `settings.defaultSelector` key will be used.

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "webapp": "apps/webapp",
    "server": "apps/server",
    "common-lib": "libs/common-lib"
  },
  "settings": {
    "defaultSelector": [
      "webapp", 
      "server"
    ]
  }
}
```

In this example, `webapp` and `server` projects will be selected when no selector is provided.

You can use any project selector, not just an array of project names.

## Project configurations

Each `project.json` file will contain *targets* that are part of the project. 

A target is a single unit of work in your development cycle, for e.g : `build`, `test`, `deploy`.

Blaze does not enforce how your development cycle should look like. We strongly encourage using consistent target names across projects, but they could really be whatever you want.

Each target contains

- Code that is to be ran for each of these targets, using [provided executors](../executors/executors.mdx#standard-executors) or [custom ones](../executors/executors.mdx#custom-executors)
- Dependencies for each target (for e.g, the `build` target of the `web-app` project could depend on the `build` target of the `design-system` project)
- Cache configuration, so that Blaze knows when a target execution is not to be done again.

For more information on configuration files, you can visit :

- The [workspace configuration documentation schema](../configuration/workspace/schema.mdx).
- The [project configuration documentation schema](../configuration/project/schema.mdx).

## Describing the workspace

You can display human-readable information about the workspace by using the `describe` command.

```sh
blaze describe workspace
```

All projects will be listed in a table, along with their `description` fields.
