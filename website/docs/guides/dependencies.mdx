You can specify dependencies for any target using the `targets.*.dependencies` key.

Running the `build` target on this project will first run the `build` target on `project-2` and `project-3`:

```json title="project-1/project.json"
{
    "targets": {
        "build": {
            "executor": "std:commands",
            "options": {
                "commands": [
                    "npm run build"
                ]
            },
            "dependencies": [
                {
                    "target": "build",
                    "projects": ["project-2", "project-3"]
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

You can have as many dependencies as you like. The order in which they are declared does not matter.

Dependencies are resolved recursively, so in the last example, if `project-2` or `project-3` have dependencies for the `build` target, they will be resolved as well in the target execution graph.

The `projects` key must be a valid project selector, similar to items declared at the [workspace configuration `settings.selectors` key](./workspace.mdx#named-selectors).

The `target` key must be a target name and is mandatory.

:::info

If a target must depend on another target within the same project, you can omit the `projects` key on the dependency. You can even simply pass the target name and it will work the same.

:::info

If a target must depend on a single target from another another, you can omit the `projects` key on the dependency and pass the project name and target using this format: `project:target`.

## Ignore unmet dependencies

Sometimes, some dependencies cannot be satisfied due to an execution failure, if you want to ignore that, you can use the `optional` flag.

```json title="main-project/project.json"
{
    "targets": {
        "build": {
            "executor": "std:commands",
            "options": {
                "commands": [
                    "npm run build"
                ]
            },
            "dependencies": [
                {
                    "target": "other-project:build",
                    "optional": true
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

In that case, if the `optional-project:build` target fails, then the project's `build` target will be executed anyway and a warning will be emitted.

Note that an unmet dependency can mean two things :

- One of the dependency's targets executions failed.
- One of the dependency's targets could not be executed because its own dependencies were not met.

## Cache propagation

By default, cache is propagated from the dependency to the dependent target.

It means that if the dependency was either never cached or has just invalidated its cache, the dependent target will also invalidate its cache.

You can disable this behavior by using the `cachePropagation` property :

```json title="project-1/project.json"
{
    "targets": {
        "build": {
            "executor": "std:commands",
            "options": {
                "commands": [
                    "npm run build"
                ]
            },
            "dependencies": [
                {
                    "target": "project-2:build",
                    "cachePropagation": "Never"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

In that example, when `project-2:build` is freshly executed, `project-1:build` will not invalidate its cache because of it. 

Possible values are :

- `Always`: Always propagate cache. The default value.
- `Never`: Never propagate cache. In that case, cache will not be invalidated for this target when the dependency is freshly executed.
