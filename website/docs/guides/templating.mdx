Some useful templating features are provided when writing configuration files such as :

- Workspace configuration file
- Project configuration files

## Basic string interpolation

All strings can contain interpolated data, whether you are using pure JSON, YAML or Jsonnet :

```json title = "project.json"
{
    "targets": {
        "print-message": {
            "executor": "std:commands",
            "options": {
                "commands": [
                    {
                        "program": "echo",
                        "arguments": ["{{ vars.message }}"]
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This `print-message` target will print the value contained in the `vars.message` custom variable.

:::info

The `vars` prefix indicates that you want to interpolate a [custom variable](#custom-variables).

:::

## Global variables

These variables are always available (in both workspace and project configuration files) :

<SubstitutionVariables vars={globals}/>

## Dynamic configuration

Sometimes, you need more than just interpolating strings, for example : 

- If you want your configuration file to have a dynamic structure
- If you want to pass a variable of any type outside of a string literal, without the `{{ }}` syntax.

When using Jsonnet, all variables are imported through the external variable `blaze` when compiling your template.

For example, if we need to have different arguments according to the current OS for a command launched through the `std:commands` executor :

```jsonnet title="project.jsonnet"
{
    local blaze = std.extVar('blaze'),
    targets: {
        clean: {
            executor: 'std:commands',
            options: {
                commands: if blaze.family == "unix"
                    then [
                        {
                            program: 'rm',
                            arguments: ['-rf', 'dist']
                        },
                    ] else [
                        {
                            program: 'del',
                            arguments: ['dist']
                        }
                    ]
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Jsonnet libraries

A good way to refactor your configurations is to create Jsonnet libraries.

They usually are made of `.libsonnet` files that you can import inside your configuration files.

It can be quite difficult to deal with relative paths imports.

You can easily add Jsonnet library paths by creating a `.blaze/.jpath` file (if it does not already exist).

Let's say we have a `helper.libsonnet` file in our library path.

```
├── libs/
|   ├── jsonnet/
|   |   ├── helper.libsonnet
``` 

We need to provide our libraries' parent directory in our `.blaze/.jpath`. 

Directories must be provided line per line.

Relative paths are analyzed from the workspace root directory. Absolute paths are also supported, but not recommended. Non-existent paths will be silently ignored.

If we add the following line to our `.jpath` file, direct import using `import 'helper.libsonnet'` should work in Jsonnet files :

```txt title=".blaze/.jpath"
libs/jsonnet/
```

## Templating helpers

Blaze templating system uses [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) under the hood.

### Standard Handlebars helpers

All the [standard helpers](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/builtin-helpers.html#if) are available. 

These helpers include if/else conditions, loops, debugging utilities and more...

### Blaze built-in helpers

Blaze also provides two useful helpers :

- The `shell` helper, for interpolating any system command output.
- The `random` helper, for interpolating random string of arbitrary size.

#### The `shell` helper

Basic usage is as follows :

```json
"{{ shell \"whoami\" trim=true }}"
```

This will print the result of the `whoami` command. The `trim` parameter is here to remove any trailing whitespace at the end of the command output.

The `shell` helper always run commands in a shell. You can also customize the shell path and kind, just like the [`std:commands` executor](../executors/std/commands#using-a-shell).

```json
"{{ shell \"whoami\" shell=\"/bin/bash\" shellKind=\"Posix\" trim=true }}"
```

By default, commands provided to the `shell` helper run at the workspace root. You can customize this location by providing a `cwd` parameter.

```json
// this will output /tmp
"{{ shell \"pwd\" cwd=\"/tmp\" }}"
```

#### The `random` helper

Basic usage is as follows :

```json
"{{ random 16 }}"
```

This will interpolate a random alphanumerical string of length 16, like this :

`a514Snw21Rf59JpC`

The generation is done through [`rand::rngs::ThreadRng`](https://docs.rs/rand/latest/rand/rngs/struct.ThreadRng.html).

:::warning

A new value will be generated everytime the file is parsed, so be careful since this might cause unwanted cache invalidation.

:::

### Custom template helpers

You can create your own helpers in the form of [`rhai` scripts](https://rhai.rs/book/).

Create a script file in `.blaze/helpers` :

```
+-- .blaze
    +-- helpers
        +-- my-uppercase.rhai
```

:::info

The script filenames must match the following regular expression in order to be picked up by Blaze : `^[a-zA-Z0-9\-_]\.rhai$`.

:::

We can then write the script code, in this example we simply take the first indexed parameter that is given to the helper and make it uppercase, assuming it is a string.

``` title=".blaze/helpers/my-uppercase.rhai"
let input = params[0];

input.make_uppercase();

input
```

Finally we can use the helper anywhere in a template string.

```json
"{{ my-uppercase  \"Hello world!\" }}"
```

The interpolated value will then be: `HELLO WORLD!`.

:::info

Handlebars helpers support both indexed and hash (named) parameters.

- Indexed parameters are accessed using the `params` variable.
- Hash (named) parameters are accessed using the `hash` variable.

:::


## Custom variables

You can store custom variables at the workspace root, in a global file called `.blaze/variables.json`.

```json title=".blaze/variables.json"
{
    "vars": {
        "message": "Hello world!",
        "some": {
            "nested": {
                "variable": 1
            }
        },
        "some-values": [1, 2, 3]
    }
}
```

:::info

This configuration file also supports Jsonnet and YAML.

:::

### Extra variable files

You can add also add extra files paths with the `include` key, This can be useful if you want to have non-versioned, user-provided variables :

```json  title=".blaze/variables.json"
{
    "vars": {
        "my-message": "Hello world!"
    },
    "include": [
        "{{ root }}/user-variables.json"
    ]
}
```

```json title="user-variables.json"
{
    "my-message": "What's up world?"
}
```

In this example, the variable named `my-message` will be overriden with a new value `What's up world?`.

Relative paths will be analyzed from the `.blaze` directory. Absolute paths are also supported.

Missing files will be considered as an error. If you want any of these files to be optional, you can use the following syntax :

```json title=".blaze/variables.json"
{
    "vars": {
        "global-var": "Hello world!"
    },
    "include": [
        {
            "path": "{{ root }}/optional-user-variables.json",
            "optional": true
        }
    ]
}
```

:::info

These extra configuration file also supports Jsonnet and YAML.

:::

### Variables overriding order

This is the order in which variables are being analyzed and might override the previous ones :

1) Global variables declared at the `vars` key of `.blaze/variables.json`
2) Extra file declared at the `include` key of `.blaze/variables.json` (in the order of declaration)
3) User provided variables files through the `--vars-file` command line option.
4) User provided variables through the `--json-var`, `--jsonnet-var`, `yaml-var` command line options.
5) User provided variables through the `--str-var` command line option. 

Overriding is done using [JSON Merge Patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7396)

:::warning

If you override variables with a non-object value, it will completely replace the previous state. 
Be careful when using YAML since an empty file will be deserialized as `null`. Use an empty object notation `{}` instead.
