## Declaring targets

Here is an example of a project configuration file, containing a single `build` target :

```json title="project.json"
{
    "targets": {
        "build": {
            "executor": "std:commands",
            "options": {
                "commands": [
                    "cargo build"
                ]
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The `targets` key of our project configuration is an object where keys are target names.

For each target key, we associate a configuration object that describes the target.

Namely, we will find in there everything that deals with :

- What should be run ?
- What is the cache strategy ?
- What are the dependencies (other targets to be ran before this one) ?

:::info

You can have as many targets as you like, we recommend to use consistent target names across projects since it allows launching the same target for multiple projects in a single `run` command.

On the last project example, if we run the `build` target, the `npm run build` command will be executed.

## Executor configuration

The `executor` key indicates which [*executor*](../executors/executors.mdx) we want to use. 

An executor defines what kind of action we want to perform. Each executor works differently, and they are identified using URLs. 

In our example, we are using the `std:commands` executor:

- The `std:` scheme is a special scheme that means we need to resolve a standard (built-in) executor. 
- `commands` is the name of the standard executor, it allows us to simply run arbitrary system commands.

[Learn more about executors](../executors) (how to configure them and create new ones from scratch).

## Passing options to the executor

Executors can have options as an input.

The executor options are declared at the `options` key of our target configuration.

The expected value will depend on the executor that you are using.

## Noop targets

If you don't provide any executor for some targets, then the target will effectively *do nothing*.

We call these *noop* targets.

It can be very useful in some use cases.

### Group targets across the workspace

This behavior can be used to create *groups* of targets within a single one, using the `dependencies` options.

In this example, running the `pipeline` target will not do anything on its own, but it will run the `build`, `test` and `lint` targets for the same project.

Note that the `pipeline` target will fail if any of the dependencies fail to execute.

```json
{
    "targets": {
        "build": {
            // ... some configuration ...
        },
        "test": {
            // ... some configuration ...
        },
        "lint": {
            // ... some configuration ...
        },
        "pipeline": {
            "dependencies": [
                "build",
                "test",
                "deploy"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

More generally, creating noop targets with the `dependencies` key can be used to create target aliases, or to extend cache settings for an existing target.

### Cached items

Another use case for *noop* targets is to only act as *cached items*.

Blaze cache system is meant to invalidate cache in a target by target manner.

For example, if a project `a`'s `build` target depends on project `b`'s source code you could write this cache configuration :   

```json title="a/project.json"
{
    "targets": {
        "build": {
            "cache": {
                "invalidateWhen": {
                    "inputChanges": [
                        {
                            "root": "{{ root }}/{{ workspace.projects.b.path }}",
                            "pattern": "src/**/*"
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This is not ideal for several reasons :

- If any other target depends on `b` project source code, you would have to write the same invalidation strategy for it. Cache information would then be duplicated and the invalidation process would happen twice. 
- We are referencing files belonging to project `b` in project `a` and this could easily break. 

Dependencies across targets must be specified only with the `dependencies` key. Since cache invalidation is propagated by default from dependency to parent, we can simply write the following configuration:

```json title="b/project.json"
{
    "targets": {
        "source": {
            "cache": {
                "invalidateWhen": {
                    "inputChanges": [
                        "src/**/*"
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```json title="a/project.json"
{
    "targets": {
        "build": {
            "executor": "std:commands",
            "options": {
                // some compilation options...
            },
            "dependencies": [
                "b:source"
            ],
            "cache": {}
        }
    }
}
```

The `source` target in project `b` is the *cached item*. It does not do anything on its own, but it can be referenced in project `a`'s dependencies.

If the `source` target's cache is invalidated, then project `a`'s `build` cache will also be invalidated.

This strategy allows for cache reusage and higher maintainability.

## Describing targets 

You can display human-readable information about targets for a specific project with the `describe` command.

```sh
blaze describe project <name of the project>
```

Each target will be listed with its name and its `description` field in a table.

Each target name will then displayed, line per line.

```
blaze describe project -s
```

:::info

For more options, checkout the [`describe` command documentation](../cli/describe).

## Running the same target in multiple Blaze processes

By default, a target can be executed by only one process at a time.

If a target is already being executed in another process, Blaze will block and wait for it to finish.

You can add a `stateless` flag to any target if you don't want this behavior.

```json title="project.json"
{
    "targets": {
        "my-target": {
            "stateless": true
        }
    }
}
```

:::warning

Make sure that the target does not deal with state when placing `stateless` to `true`.
