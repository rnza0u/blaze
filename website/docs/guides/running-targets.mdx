The `run` command is used in order to run a target on a selection of projects.

## How to run a target

Here is a basic example which runs a target called `build` on a single project called `webapp`.

```
blaze run -t build -p webapp
```

- The `-t` (or `--target`) option is used in order to provide the target name
- The `-p` (or `--projects`) option is used in order to select projects using their names (as declared in your workspace configuration at the `projects` key).

When you are launching the target for only one project, you can use a simplified syntax.

This example produces the same result as the last one :

```
blaze run webapp:build
```

## Project selectors

There are many different ways to select eligible projects to run a target.

### Multiple named projects

You can use the `-p` / `--projects` flag in order to select multiple projects by their names.

Just provide as a comma-separated list of project names.

```sh
blaze run -p project1,project2,project3 -t some-target 
```

Any non-existing project within the list will result in an error.

### Using a regular expression

You can select projects which names match on a regular expression using the `-r` / `--regex` flag.

The expression is compiled and matched against using the [`regex`](https://docs.rs/regex-syntax/1/regex_syntax/) Rust crate.

```sh
blaze run -r '^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$' -t build
```

### All projects

You can also select all projects using the `-a` / `--all` flag.

```sh
blaze run -a -t build
```

### Using tags

You can select projects that match some tags.

```sh
blaze run --tags tag1,tag2,tag3 -t build
```

## Using named selectors

You can have project selectors declared at the workspace level :

```json title="workspace.json"
{
    "settings": {
        "selectors": {
            "apps": ["app-1", "app-2", "app-3"]
        }
    }
}
```

The `-s`, or `--selector` is used to specify the name of the selector :

```sh
blaze run -s apps -t build
```

This will run the `build` target on 3 different projects: `app-1`, `app-2` and `app-3`.

[Checkout this link](./workspace.mdx#named-selectors) if you want to know more about named selectors.

### Default projects

If you don't specify any project selector, projects declared in your workspace settings at the `defaultSelector` key will be selected.

```
blaze run -t build
```

This will run the `build` target using a default selector, or fail if there is no defaut selector.

The `defaultSelector` setting can take any project selector. Checkout this [documentation](./workspace.mdx#default-selector) in order to know more.

## Parallelism

By default, Blaze executes targets sequentially.

You can override this behavior using the `--parallelism` option.

```sh
# run the `build` target on all projects, with at most two tasks in parallel.  
blaze -t build -a --parallelism 2

# run the `build` target on all projects, with as many tasks in parallel as possible.  
blaze -t build -a --parallelism All

# run the `build` target on all projects, with at most one task per available processing unit on your system.
blaze -t build -a --parallelism Cores
 
# run the `build` target on all projects, sequentially.
blaze -t build -a --parallelism None
```

## Check the execution graph before running

It is possible to preview the execution graph before actually running the targets.

You can do so by using the `--dry-run` flag :

```
blaze --dry-run my-app:build
```

The `run` command will then do everything except actually executing the targets. Please note that executors will still be resolved even when using the `--dry-run` flag.
