title: Environment variables
---

Blaze loads environment variables from two different files:

- `.env`: Versioned file for global default environment variables.
- `.user.env`: Non-versioned file for user-provided global environment variables.

Only the `.user.env` should be used to contain sensitive data. Both of these files must be placed at the root of your workspace in order to be picked up by Blaze.

Please note that any variable in these files will be set only if it was primarily unset. You can still override them using the command line.
