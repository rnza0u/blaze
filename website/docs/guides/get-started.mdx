Let's follow a few steps and we'll get you started in less than 10 minutes.

## Choose an installation method

Blaze comes packaged as a single executable file.

It can be installed on all platforms that support the Rust runtime and Node.js (Linux, MacOS, Windows).

There are two ways to install it :

- [Using pre-built binaries](#installing-using-pre-built-binaries)
- [Compiling from source code](#installing-from-source-code)

## Installing using pre-built binaries

Pre-built binaries are provided for the most common platforms.

If you want to skip this guide and install the binary by yourself, you can go ahead and find direct download links for each platform [here](/downloads).

### Install for Linux or Mac OSX

Just copy and paste one of the following scripts into your terminal and Blaze will install itself.

:::info

These scripts might assume that you are using `sudo` on your system. You can also run them directly as `root`.

:::

<CodeAlternatives alternatives={
  [
    {
      name: 'Linux (GNU x64)',
      type: 'linux',
      platform: 'x86_64-linux-gnu'
    },
    {
      name: 'Linux (Musl x64)',
      type: 'linux',
      platform: 'x86_64-linux-musl'
    },
    {
      name: 'OSX (x64)',
      type: 'osx',
      platform: 'x86_64-osx'
    },
    {
      name: 'OSX (aarch64)',
      type: 'osx',
      platform: 'aarch64-osx'
    }
  ].map(({ name, type, platform }) => ({
    name,
    view: {
      language: 'sh'
    },
    code: [
      `curl -sSf --tlsv1.3 https://downloads.blaze-monorepo.dev/versions/latest/builds/${platform}/package | tar zx`,
      type === 'linux' ? 'sudo install -t /usr/local/bin blaze' : 'sudo cp blaze /usr/local/bin'
    ].join('\n')
  }))
} />

Then verify everything went well by checking the installed Blaze version :

```sh
blaze version
```

### Install on Windows

- <BrowserOnly>{() => <a target="_blank" href={downloadUrl('latest', 'x86_64-windows').toString()}>Download the latest package for Windows.</a>}</BrowserOnly>
- Extract `blaze.exe` anywhere on your system.
- Add its parent directory to your `Path` environment variable.
- Restart your shell environment and run `blaze version`.

## Installing from source code

<BrowserOnly>{
  () => <WithLatestVersion>{
      version => <>
        <p>
          You can install your own binary <a target="_blank" href={`https://github.com/rnza0u/blaze.git`}>from the source code</a> using different methods.
        </p>
        
        <p>You will need a Rust nightly toolchain (&gt;=2024-06-25). You can download it using <a href="https://rustup.rs"><code>rustup</code></a> :</p>

        <CodeBlock>
          rustup install nightly-2024-06-25
        </CodeBlock>

        <Admonition type='info'>
          By default, the provided scripts will build the last version of Blaze, so you might want to modify the version number.
        </Admonition>

        <p>In order to use all Blaze features, you will also need the following tools on your system :</p>

        <ul>
          <li>A C compiler</li>
          <li><code>pkg-config</code></li>
          <li>OpenSSL development packages (for example, <code>libssl-dev</code> on Ubuntu or <code>openssl-devel</code> on Fedora.)</li>
        </ul>

          {`cargo +nightly-2024-06-25 install -Z bindeps blaze-cli@${version}`}
        </CodeBlock>

        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.25rem' }}>Second method (using a build script)</h3>

        <p>This method will build everything from scratch, including non-Rust code and assets.</p>

        <p>It requires <a href="https://nodejs.org">Node.js</a> (&gt;= 18.17) and NPM to be installed locally along the Rust toolchain. </p>

        <p>It is only supported on Linux systems but it might also work on other platforms such as OSX.</p>

        <CodeBlock language='sh'> 
          {
            [
              `git clone --depth 1 --branch blaze-${version} https://github.com/rnza0u/blaze.git`,
              './main/blaze/bootstrap.sh'
            ].join('\n')
          }
        </CodeBlock>

        <Admonition type="warning">
          If you have permissions issues when launching <code>bootstrap.sh</code> and you are using <code>sudo</code> on your system, set the <code>USE_SUDO</code> variable before execution.

## Setting up your monorepo

Once you're ready, you can initialize a new Blaze monorepo in your current working directory using the `init` command :

```sh
blaze init
```

:::info

The `init` command's behavior can be customized. [Checkout its documentation](/docs/cli/init) in order to know more. 

:::

The generated `workspace.jsonnet` is your monorepo main configuration file. It is where you will be adding your projects.

For now, there should only one declared project (which is just a demo project).

## Running your first target

A target could be defined as a development cycle step (for example compiling, testing, deploying etc...).

The `init` creates by default a demo project with a simple *Hello world* target. Let's see how it works.

From the top of our workspace, we should have the following file structure :

```
├── workspace.jsonnet
├── hello-world-root/
|   ├── project.jsonnet
```

First, explore the `workspace.jsonnet` file. There should be a project reference named `example-project`.

```json title="workspace.json"
{
  "name": "<name of your workspace>",
  "projects": {
    "example-project": {
      "path": "example-project",
      "tags": [],
      "description": "A demo project for your new workspace !"
    }
  },
  "settings": {
    // ... more keys ...
  }
}
```

It is indicated that a project named `example-project` lives inside the `example-project` directory.

Inside this directory, the project is configured inside a `example-project/project.json` file.

```json title="hello-world/project.json"
{
  "targets": {
    "say-hello": {
      "executor": "std:commands",
        "options": {
          "commands": [
            {
                "program": "echo",
                "arguments": ["{{ vars.demo-message }}"]
            }
          ]
        }
    }
  }
}
```

In this project, only one target is defined, it is named `say-hello`.

Any target in Blaze can rely on what we call an *executor*. It is what makes the target *do something*.

The one that we are using in this case allows us to run shell commands (`std:commands`). It is configured through the `options` key.

Let's try it by running our target :

```sh
$ blaze run example-project:say-hello
```

Let's checkout the output:

```
[INFO] 1 target(s) will be executed (["example-project:say-hello"])
[INFO] 1 executor reference(s) will be resolved (["std:commands"])
[INFO] + echo Hello world!
Hello world!

Execution graph results:

example-project:say-hello (executed in 1.1286ms)
```

All good. Now we can create real targets for real projects !
