# The `cargo` scheme

:::warning

This feature is still is development and will be available in Alpha release

:::

When using the `cargo` scheme, Blaze will load the executor from a specific Cargo package.

```json
{
    "executor": "cargo:///my-custom-executor-crate"
}
```

The following URL formats are supported :

- `cargo:///<crate-name>`: Will fetch `crate-name` from the official [crates.io](https://crates.io) registry.
- `cargo://<custom-registry>[:<port>]/<crate-name>`: Will fetch `crate-name` from `custom-registry`, which can be any valid host, along with an optional port number. 

You can provide more options as well using this syntax :

```json
{
    "executor": {
        "url": "cargo:///my-custom-executor-crate",
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "insecure": false,
        "token": "{{ environment.CARGO_TOKEN }}"
    }
}
```

- `version` : The crate version string, same syntax as in `Cargo.toml`
- `pull`: Always try pull a new version of the crate when resolving the executor. This has no effect if you specified a fixed version.
- `token` : The token to use when authenticating to a custom registry.
- `insecure` : When value is set to `true`, will allow non secure connections or certificate rejections when using TLS. Should be set only for debugging purposes.
