# Resolving an executor from the file system

When using the `file` scheme, Blaze will lookup for an executor source files at the specified path :

The full URL must match the following format : `file://<path>`.

```json
{
    "executor": "file://path/to/my/custom/executor"
}
```

`path` must point to the root directory of your executor source files. If it is not an absolute path, it will be treated as relative to the workspace root directory.

## Supported options

Specific options can be passed by using an object instead of a simple URL string.

The following parameters are supported :

- `url`: The `file://` URL representing the executor's root directory.
- `kind` (optional): Specify the executor type. If not specified, it will be inferred by looking at the presence of either a `package.json`, or a `Cargo.toml` file at the specified path. In most cases, you will not have to specify it explicitely. Possible values are :
    - `Rust`
    - `Node`
- `rebuild`: Choose a strategy for when Blaze should re-build the executor. Possible values are :
    - `Always`: Always rebuild the executor.
    - `OnChange`: Rebuild when files have changed.
- `watch`: An array of file changes matcher which works like the the [`cache.invalidateWhen.inputChanges` keys of your targets configuration](../../guides/caching.mdx#invalidate-when-input-files-change).

The default options are the following :

```json
{
    "executor": {
        "url": "file://path/to/my/custom/executor",
        "build": "OnChanges",
        "watch": [
            {
                "pattern": "**",
                "exclude": [
                    "target/**",
                    "node_modules/**"
                ],
                "behavior": "Mixed"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
