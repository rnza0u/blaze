# The `npm` scheme

:::warning

This feature is still is development and will be available in Alpha release

:::

When using the `npm` scheme, Blaze will load the executor from the specified NPM package.

Here are a few examples :

- `npm:///my-custom-executor` fetches `my-custom-executor` from the official NPM registry.
- `npm://npm.my-company.com/my-custom-executor` fetches `my-custom-executor` from a private NPM registry called `npm.my-company.com`. 

The full URL must match the following format : `npm://[<host>[:<port>]]/<package>`

If the `host`/`port` part is not provided, the official NPM registry located at `https://registry.npmjs.org` will be used.

NPM executors can only be [Node executors](../languages/node).

You will need `npm` to be installed on your system. You can provide your own path to the `npm` program with the `BLAZE_NPM_LOCATION` environment variable. 

In most cases, NPM executors can be referenced using a simple URL.

```json
{
    "executor": "npm:///my-custom-executor"
}
```

## Specifying the version

By default, the latest version for the package is fetched. You can set a custom version with the `version` parameter.

You can use any version syntax that is supported by `npm install`.

```json
{
    "executor": {
        "url": "npm:///my-custom-executor",
        "version": "1.0.0"
    }
}
```

## Authentication

The following authentication modes are supported when resolving executors from NPM :

- Using a username and password
- Using an access token

:::info

By default, credentials from any global NPM configuration (for e.g, your `~/.npmrc` file) will be used.

:::

### Username and password authentication

In order to authenticate using a username/password, you can use the following configuration :

```json
{
    "executor": {
        "url": "npm:///my-custom-executor",
        "authentication": {
            "username": "{{ environment.NPM_USER }}",
            "password": "{{ environment.NPM_PASSWORD }}"
        }
    }
}
```

### Access token authentication

Access token authentication can be done using the following configuration :

```json
{
    "executor": {
        "url": "npm:///my-custom-executor",
        "authentication": {
            "token": "{{ environment.NPM_TOKEN }}"
        }
    }
}
```

## Other configuration options

Other configuration keys are :

- `insecure`: when set to `true`, SSL/TLS certificate rejections will be ignored when connecting to the registry. Use only for debugging purpose.
- `pull`: If you want to always pull a new version from the registry, set this value to `true`. This has no effect if you specified a fixed version.
