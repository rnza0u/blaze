# Resolve an executor using Git

You can resolve an executor from any Git repository using different transport protocols.

## Using HTTP

```json
{
    "executor": {
        "url": "https://github.com/username/my-executor.git",
        "format": "Git"
    }
}
```

## Using SSH

When using the `ssh://` protocol, Blaze will retrieve the executor files from a Git repository on a SSH remote host.

You will need to provide the path to the Git repo on the remote side, as well as transport and authentication options.

```json
{
    "executor": {
        "url": "ssh://github.com/my-username/my-executor.git",
        "insecure": false,
        "fingerprints": [
            "SHA256:uNiVztksCsDhcc0u9e8BujQXVUpKZIDTMczCvj3tD2s",
            "SHA256:p2QAMXNIC1TJYWeIOttrVc98/R1BUFWu3/LiyKgUfQM",
            "SHA256:+DiY3wvvV6TuJJhbpZisF/zLDA0zPMSvHdkr4UvCOqU"
        ],
        "authentication": {
            "key": "{{ environment.HOME }}/my-private-key.pem",
            "passphrase": "{{ environment.PRIVATE_KEY_PASSPHRASE }}",
            "username": "git"
        }
    }
}
```

SSH URLs must have the following format : `ssh://[<username>@]<host>[:<port>]/<path>`

The following parameters are supported :

- `insecure` : This flag will completely disable remote host key validation mecanisms when the SSH connection is started. Defaults to `false` and must only be used for debugging purposes and will effectively create an insecure context. 
- `fingerprints` (*optional*): An array of server key fingerprints that can be used in order to validate the server host key.  
- `authentication` (*optional*): An [SSH authentication object](#ssh-authentication-methods) containing credentials to use when authenticating.

Note that the `~/.ssh/known_hosts` file will always be used in first instance when verifying the server's public key.

We strongly recommend to always provide the `fingerprints` parameter in case Blaze is executed on a machine that does not know the SSH remote host.

You can easily generate fingerprints by using the following command :

```sh
ssh-keyscan my-ssh-server.com | ssh-keygen -lf -
```

### SSH Authentication methods

The following authentication methods are supported :

- Private key based
- Password based

#### Using a private key

```json
{
    "key": "{{ environment.HOME }}/my-private-key.pem",
    "passphrase": "{{ environment.PRIVATE_KEY_PASSPHRASE }}",
    "username": "git"
}
```

- `key`: Path to the private key file.
- `passphrase` (*optional*): The passphrase to use for decrypting the private key file.
- `username` (*optional*): The username to use when authenticating (if not already provided in the URL).

#### Using a username and password

```json
{
    "username": "{{ environment.HOME }}/my-private-key.pem",
    "passphrase": "{{ environment.PRIVATE_KEY_PASSPHRASE }}",
    "username": "git"
}
```

- `password`: The password to use when authenticating.
- `username` (*optional*): The username to use when authenticating (if not already provided in the URL).

## Using the Git protocol

```json
{
    "executor": "git://my-git-server.com/my-executor.git"
}
```

Only the `git://` scheme supports providing a single URL as an executor reference.

## Git related options

- `branch` : Checkout a specific branch. For example `master`.
- `tag`: Checkout a commit referenced by a particular tag. For example `1.0`.
- `rev`: Checkout a commit referenced by a particular [revision string](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitrevisions#_specifying_revisions). For example `f2c6b1f2e9cbe24a124762c13aa2d0def2466cf8`.
- `path` : Path to the executor files from the repository index. Defaults to the repository index `/`.
- `kind` : Specify the executor project type. Similar as [the `kind` option when resolving executors from the file system](./file-system.mdx#supported-options).
- `pull`: If `true`, Blaze will always try to pull last changes from the repository. `false` is set by default. Please note that this option must be kept to `false` if something like a commit hash was specified using the `rev` Option.

If the `branch`, `tag` or `rev` parameter is not supplied, the default branch will be checked out.
