The `std:commands` executor is used to order to execute some system commands.

It is the most common executors in Blaze.

```json
{
    "executor": "std:commands",
    "options": {
        "commands": [
            "npm run build",
            "npm run test",
            "npm run deploy"
        ]
    }
}
```

In this example, these three commands will be executed sequentially.

You can customize commands by providing objects instead of raw strings in the `commands` array.

## Providing a program to run

The `program` option is required if you provide a command in its object form.

It can be :

- A program on your `PATH` variable
- A relative path to a program, from the current working directory
- An absolute path to a program

Your program can be valid executable file or a script with a valid shebang as its first line (for example `#!/bin/sh`, or `#!/usr/bin/env node`), you can also call it.

```json
{
    "commands": [
        {
            "program": "ls"
        }
    ]
}

```

On Windows, you can only call executable files such as `.exe`. If you want to call a script in Windows you could use the `shell` option.

```json
{
    "commands": [
        // call script using its absolute path
        "{{ project.root }}/scripts/my_script.ps1"
    ],
    // launch commands directly into powershell
    "shell": "powershell"
}

```

:::info

If you only want to launch a single script file, you should use the [`std:exec` standard executor](./exec.mdx).

:::

## Providing arguments

You can provide arguments for the command using the `arguments` options.

```json
{
    "commands": [
        {
            "program": "cargo",
            "arguments": [
                "build", 
                "--release"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

```

When you're using the command short form, the provided command string is split at every whitespace and the first substring will be treated as the `program` option, the rest of the array will be set as the `arguments` options.

This behavior is applied only when the `shell` options is set to `false` (which is the default).

:::warning

Be aware that passing a string that contains shell-specific syntax can cause unwanted behavior if you use don't use the `shell` option.

:::

## Using a shell

Sometimes, you need to evaluate shell expressions such as variables, subcommands, computed values etc...

You can launch commands in a shell by using the `shell` option.

```json
{
    "command": [
        "echo $SHELL" // prints /bin/sh
    ],
    "shell": true
}
```

When set to `true`, commands will be launched using `/bin/sh` on Unix systems, or `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe` on Windows.

You can also provide your own shell using a program path :

```json
{
    "executor": "std:commands",
    "options": {
        "command": [
            "Write-Host 'Hello, World!'"
        ],
        "shell": "powershell"
    }
}
```

Supported shell types are :
- On Unix :
    - sh
    - bash
- On Windows :
    - cmd
    - powershell

If you shell program is at a custom location, you can specify its path through the `shell` option.

The provided string can be any same type of value that the commands' `program` parameter accepts.

```json
{
    "commands": [
        "echo $SHELL" // prints /custom/path/to/sh
    ],
    "shell": "/custom/path/to/sh"
}

```

Blaze will try to infer which shell type it is from the program name.

If, for some reason, Blaze cannot infer what shell type you need, you can specify it explicitly by providing an object instead of a raw string :

```json
{
    "executor": "std:commands",
    "options": {
        "commands": [],
        "shell": {
            "kind": "Posix", // can be "Posix", "Powershell" or "Cmd".
            "program": "/custom/path/to/my-bash"
        }
    }
}
```

If your shell type is not supported, you can still call the shell program directly without the `shell` option.

In fact, the `shell` option is a short syntax for doing so.

```json
{
    "commands": [
        // prints /bin/sh
        {
            "program": "/bin/sh",
            "arguments": [
                "-c", 
                "echo $SHELL"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

```

Is the same as :

```json
{
    "commands": [
        "echo $SHELL"
    ],
    "shell": "/bin/sh"
}

```

## Run commands in the background

You can use the `detach` option if you want to run a command as a detached process.

Detached means any of the following commands will not wait for this process to terminate before being executed.

It can be useful if you want a long running operation to be non-blocking and run in the background while other commands are running sequentially.

```json
{
    "commands": [
        {
            "program": "npm",
            "arguments": ["start"],
            "detach": true
        },
        "npm run test:e2e"
    ],
}
```

It also allows running multiple commands in parallel.

:::info

Be sure to checkout the [onFailure](#command-failure-strategies) option if you want to handle how detached processes are terminated when a failure occurs.

:::

## Set environment variables

The `environment` key allows you to add custom environment variables for specific commands.

Each of these variables will be set at the command child process level.

```json
{
    "commands": [
        {
            "program": "echo",
            "arguments": ["$SOME_VARIABLE"],
            "environment": {
                "SOME_VARIABLE": "Hello world!"
            }
        }
    ],
    "shell": true
}
```

In this example, we also use the <a href="#using-a-shell">`shell`</a> option because we are displaying the variable through the `echo` command. It can be useful if you want to use environment variables within the command itself. 

## Command failure strategies

By default, if any of the commands fails, the executor will not run any of the pending commands and will wait for detached processes to finish, you can customize this behavior using the `onFailure` option.

### `ForceExit`

If you want to immediately terminate all detached processes if a particular command fails, you can use `ForceExit` as a value.

```json
{
    "commands": [
        {
            "program": "sleep",
            "arguments": ["30"],
            "detached": true
        },
        {
            "program": "false",
            "onFailure": "ForceExit"
        }
    ]
}

```

In this example, the second command will always fail (that's what the `false` program does).

The first command will eventually not last 30 seconds because it is going to be killed as soon as the second command terminates.

### `Ignore`

You can also choose to completely ignore failure for specific commands by using the `Ignore` value.

```json
{
    "commands": [
        {
            "program": "false",
            "onFailure": "Ignore"
        },
        "echo Hello world!"
    ]
}

```

In this example, the first command's failure will be ignored and the second command will be executed.

### `Restart`

If you want to restart a command that fails, you can use the `Restart` value.

This can be useful if your command is likely to fail in some circumstances.

It can also be used in order to produce some sort of a retry loop (when starting up a local server for example).

```json
{
    "commands": [
        // start application server
        {
            "program": "npm",
            "arguments": [
                "start", 
                "--" 
                "--port", "8080", 
                "--host", "127.0.0.1"
            ],
            "detached": true
        }
        // try to connect to the server, restart until server is listening.
        {
            "program": "netcat",
            "arguments": ["-z", "127.0.0.1", "8080"],
            "onFailure": "Restart"
        },
        // launch some E2E tests
        "npm run test"
    ],
    "shell": "sh"
}
```

### `Exit`

If the command fails, the executor will wait for any detached processes to terminate and then return with an error.

This is the default behavior if you don't specify any value.

## Custom working directory

By default, commands will run at the project root directory.

If you want to set the current directory explicitly for the command process, you can use the `cwd` parameter :

```json
{
    "commands": [
        {
            "program": "ls",
            "cwd": "/path/to/directory"
        }
    ]
}
```

This example will print the files in `/path/to/directory`.

## Hide command output

If you don't want to print any output for some commands, you can use the `quiet` flag.

```json
{
    "commands": [
        {
            "program": "echo",
            "arguments": ["you can't see me!"],
            "quiet": true
        }
    ]
}
```
