The `std:exec` executor is used to order to execute a file, optionally using a system provided shell.

The file could be be :

- Any executable file for your current platform
- A script, like bash, powershell or python

Supported options are :

- `program` *(required)*: Path to the file to execute. Relative paths will be treated as relative to the project's root directory.
- `arguments`: A list of arguments that will be passed when executing the file. Defaults to an empty array.
- `cwd`: Custom working directory to set for the spawned process.
- `shell`: Specifies a custom shell program to use when launching the file. This is useful when you are launching a script and you want Blaze to deal with passing shell specific options for this purpose. Syntax is the same as in the [`std:commands` executor](./commands#using-a-shell).
- `quiet`: Disable process output.

```json
{
    "executor": "std:exec",
    "options": {
        "program": "{{ root }}/scripts/build.sh",
        "arguments": ["arg1", "arg2", "arg3"],
        "cwd": "/working/dir",
        "shell": "/bin/sh"
    }
}
```
