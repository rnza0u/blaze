# Node custom executors

Custom Blaze executors can be written using the [Node Javascript runtime](https://nodejs.org).

Usage of Node executors requires that `node` and `npm` are installed locally.

The minimum required versions are the following:

- Node >= 18.17
- NPM >= 9.6.7

You can customize the location of Node and NPM binaries by using the following environment variables:

- `BLAZE_NODE_LOCATION`
- `BLAZE_NPM_LOCATION`

## How to write a Node executor ?

A Node executor is a regular NPM project :

```
+-- src
    +-- index.ts
+-- package.json
+-- tsconfig.json
```

Your `package.json` file must contain the following dependencies and metadata :

```json title="package.json"
{
    "name": "my-executor",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "type": "module",
    "scripts": {
        // if blaze.build is set to true, the build script will be called before using the executor for the first time
        "build": "tsc"
    },
    "dependencies": {
        "@blaze-repo/node-devkit": "^1.0.0"
    },
    "devDependencies": {
        "typescript": "latest"
    },
    "blaze": {
        "version": "1", // must be set to "1"
        "type": "executor", // must be set to "executor"
        "path": "dist/index.js", // relative path to the compiled javascript module,
        "build": true, // if true, blaze will launch the build NPM script, you can also pass a custom NPM script name.
        "install": true // if true, blaze will launch "npm install"
    }
}
```

The `@blaze-repo/node-devkit` [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blaze-repo/node-devkit) provides type definitions for writing executors.

Your compiled executor must be an ES module, so you either need to have:

- A `type` property at the root of your `package.json` file, with `module` as a value.
- An `.mjs` extension for your compiled module.

In your module source code, you only need export a single function as a default export.

```ts title="src/index.ts"
import { Executor } from '@blaze-repo/node-devkit'

const executor: Executor = async (context, options) => {
    context.logger.info('Hello Blaze!')
}

export default executor
```

The function parameters are the following:

- `context`: Provides information about the current target execution and the associated workspace/project. It also provides a `Logger` instance that can be used for writing messages through Blaze logging system.
- `options`: The configuration-specific options value for this target execution.

You can write your executor function as returning a `Promise<void>`, or simply `void` if it needs to remain synchronous. 

## Parsing the `options` object

Strict input validation is enforced through the `Value` union type :

```ts
type Value = null | number | string | boolean | { [key: string]: Value } | Array<Value>
```

You can use simple type narrowing to extract and validate user input.

For example, if the input has the following format :

```json
{
    "numbers": [1, 2, 3],
    "str": "foobar"
}
```

You will need to perform this type of validation :

```ts
import { Executor } from '@blaze-repo/node-devkit'

const executor: Executor = async (context, options) => {
    
    if (options === null || typeof options !== 'object' || Array.isArray(options)){
        throw Error('options must be an object')
    }
    
    const { numbers, str } = options

    if (!Array.isArray(numbers)){
        throw Error('"numbers" must be an array')
    }
    
    if (!numbers.every((i): i is number => typeof i === 'number')){
        throw Error('"numbers" must contain numbers')
    }
    
    if (typeof str !== 'string'){
        throw Error('"str" must be a string')
    }
    
    console.log(str.toUpperCase())
    console.log(numbers[0] + numbers[1] + numbers[2])
}

export default executor
```

You could also use librairies such as [`zod`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zod) to perform both validation and type narrowing in a more concise and declarative way.

```ts
import { Executor } from '@blaze-repo/node-devkit'
import { z } from 'zod'

const optionsSchema = z.object({
    numbers: z.array(z.number()),
    str: z.string()
})

const executor: Executor = async (context, options) => {
    
    const { str, numbers } = await optionsSchema.parseAsync(options)
    
    console.log(str.toUpperCase())
    console.log(numbers[0] + numbers[1] + numbers[2])
}

export default executor
```

## Code rules

Unhandled promise rejections mode is set to [`strict`](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--unhandled-rejectionsmode) in Node executors.

The executor still needs to execute some code after your the function has returned `void` or when the returned `Promise` is fullfilled. Consequently, calling [`process.exit`](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#processexitcode) or any API that would force termination of the current process would result in undefined behavior.

When writing asynchronous executors, you will need to make sure that all your tasks are completed before the returned `Promise` is resolved. If any asynchronous tasks are still pending after the function has returned `void` or a fullfilled `Promise`, there is no guarantee that the process will wait for their termination.

## Node executors flow

Node executors flow is the following :

- Run `npm install`.
- Run the `build` script from `package.json` if it exists.
- Dynamically import the executor function from the file referenced in `package.json` => `blaze.path`.
- Call the executor function, waiting for resolution if the return value is a `Promise<void>`.

The two first steps are skipped if the executor is already installed.
