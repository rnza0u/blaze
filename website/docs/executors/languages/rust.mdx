## Rust custom executors

Custom Blaze executors can be written using the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

Usage of Rust custom executors requires that `cargo` and a Rust toolchain are installed locally. 

Both of these can be installed using [`rustup`](https://rustup.rs).

## How to write a Rust executor ?

A Rust executor is a regular Cargo project :

```
+-- src
    +-- lib.rs
+-- Cargo.toml
```

A minimal code example would look like this :

```rust title="src/lib.rs"
use blaze_devkit::{
    value::Value,
    ExecutorContext, 
    ExecutorResult
};

#[export_name = "execute"]
pub fn execute(ctx: &ExecutorContext, options: &Value) -> ExecutorResult {
    ctx.logger.info("Hello Blaze!");
    Ok(())
}
```

The `blaze-devkit` [crates.io package](https://crates.io/crates/blaze-devkit) provides type definitions for writing Rust executors :

- The `ExecutorContext` type can be used to extract information about the workspace, or the target being executed. It also provides a `Logger` instance.
- The `Value` type represent non-structured data. It is compatible with `serde` so it can easily be converted into any type that implements `serde::Deserialize`.
- Your executor must return an `ExecutorResult` type, which is an alias for `Result<(), Box<dyn Error + Send + Sync>>`.

Your Cargo configuration file must have this form :

```toml title="Cargo.toml"
[package]
name = "my-rust-executor"
version = "1.0.0"
edition = "2021"

[package.metadata.blaze]
version = "1"
type = "executor"
exported = "execute"

[lib]
crate-type = ["dylib", "rlib"]

[dependencies]
blaze-devkit = "1"
```

## Code rules

There are several rules to be aware of when writing Rust executors.

Only unwinded panics are supported (we use [`catch_unwind`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/panic/fn.catch_unwind.html) under the hood). Panics that cannot be catched would result in undefined behavior. It is recommended to always return a valid `Result<()>` in your executor function and try to avoid panics.

Your executor function will be invoked in a separate process using the [`libloading`](https://docs.rs/libloading/latest/libloading/) crate. Some code still needs to be executed after your executor function has returned (or panicked). Consequently, forcing termination with [`std::process::exit`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/fn.exit.html) would also result in undefined behavior.

## Execution flow

Rust executors flow is the following :

- Run `cargo build --lib --release`. The `target` directory will be at the root of the executor package.
- Run a small embedded binary in a separate process. It handles the resolution of the executor function declared in the `Cargo.toml` (at the `package.metadata.blaze.exported` key).
- Run the function. If the return value is an `Err(Box<dyn Error + Send + Sync>)` or if a panic is catched, the target execution will be considered as failed. If it is an `Ok(())`, then the execution is successful.

The build step will be ignored if already done.

:::info

By default, the `cargo` program is directly called as if it was on the command line. If you want to provide a custom path to your Cargo binary, you can specify it in the `BLAZE_CARGO_LOCATION` environment variable.

:::warning

Since Rust executors rely on dynamic link library runtime loading, static musl binaries do not support it.
